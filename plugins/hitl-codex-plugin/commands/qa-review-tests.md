description: "Formal QA review of test coverage after the TDD RED phase. Verifies every acceptance criterion has a test, every LLD error mode is exercised, incident regressions are present, E2E stubs exist for all ACs, and smoke suite contribution is included. Gates implementation start."

# Review Test Coverage

Verify that the test suite produced by the TDD cycle is complete before implementation begins. This is a blocking gate — do not approve if coverage gaps exist.

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS (feature name, PR link, or LLD path)

**Graphify pre-flight:** Before the first step, run:
```bash
[ -f graphify-out/graph.json ] && echo "Graphify: available" || echo "Graphify: unavailable"
```
State the result once — "✅ Graphify available, using graph queries" or "⚠️ Graphify unavailable — using direct doc reads throughout." Apply that result for every step; do not rediscover availability mid-task.

---

## Step 1 — Read the spec

1. Read the GitHub issue to get the PRD reference (FR-<ID>), then read `docs/01-product/prd.md` at that requirement for the acceptance criteria. The PRD is the source of truth — the issue is a pointer.
2. Read the LLD at the path in `.hitl/current-change.yaml` (`source_artifacts.lld`) — note every method signature, error mode, precondition, and boundary entity
3. Read the test plan from `.hitl/current-change.yaml` under `tests.plan` — this is what the developer committed to covering
4. List the test files in `tests/` — read them

---

## Step 2 — Check incident regressions

Query the incident registry for the affected domain — prefer a graph query:
```
/graphify query "past incidents affecting domain: <domain-name>"
/graphify query "incident failure modes in <domain-name> that need regression coverage"
```
Fall back to reading `docs/04-operations/incident-registry.yaml` directly if the graph is unavailable. For each incident relevant to this domain: verify a regression test exists that would have caught it. If no incidents exist for this domain, say so explicitly — do not skip the check.

---

## Step 3 — Coverage matrix

For each item in the spec, confirm test coverage:

| Spec item | Source | Test(s) | Status |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| `<AC from PRD>` | PRD (FR-<ID>) | `<test name>` | ✅ / ❌ |
| `<method + error mode from LLD>` | LLD | `<test name>` | ✅ / ❌ |
| `<incident regression>` | Incident registry | `<test name>` | ✅ / ❌ |

Flag every ❌ as a gap that must be resolved before implementation starts.

---

## Step 4 — Review E2E and smoke suite contributions

**E2E Playwright stubs** — verify that for every PRD acceptance criterion there is a Playwright test file in `tests/e2e/features/` marked `test.skip('pending environment', ...)`. Confirm each stub targets:
- Desktop Chrome
- `devices['iPhone 15']`
- `devices['Pixel 7']`

Flag any AC that has no stub. Flag any stub that runs without `test.skip` (E2E tests must not run during RED).

**Smoke suite contribution** — verify that a journey file exists at `tests/e2e/smoke/journeys/<feature-name>.spec.ts`. Confirm it:
- Is NOT skipped (smoke suite always runs)
- Assumes a fresh customer created by `tests/e2e/smoke/setup.ts`
- Asserts a visible outcome the PM could verify
- Runs on desktop Chrome + `devices['iPhone 15']` + `devices['Pixel 7']`

If the smoke setup file (`tests/e2e/smoke/setup.ts`) does not exist yet, flag it as a gap — the developer must create it as part of this change.

---

## Step 5 — Verify measured coverage

Check `.hitl/current-change.yaml` under `required_evidence.coverage_pct`.

**If `coverage_pct` is missing or below 90%:** Block immediately.
> "Coverage gate not met. The TDD cycle must produce ≥90% line coverage before QA review proceeds. Ask the developer to run the coverage check from Phase 6 of `/tdd` and record the result in `.hitl/current-change.yaml` under `required_evidence.coverage_pct`."

**If `coverage_pct` ≥ 90%:** note it in the approval report and proceed to Step 6.

---

## Step 6 — Approve or block

**If no gaps, E2E stubs present for all ACs, smoke journey file exists, and coverage ≥ 90%:** Update the test registry at `docs/03-engineering/testing/test-registry.yaml` to record the reviewed tests. Report: "Test coverage approved. `<N>` tests cover `<M>` acceptance criteria, `<K>` LLD error modes, and `<J>` incident regressions. E2E stubs: `<P>` ACs covered. Smoke suite: journey file present. Line coverage: `<coverage_pct>`%. Implementation may proceed."

**If any gap exists (unit coverage, E2E stubs missing, smoke journey missing, coverage < 90%):** List every gap with the specific spec item it fails to cover. Do not approve. Report: "Test coverage blocked. `<N>` gap(s) found — implementation must not start until these are resolved."
