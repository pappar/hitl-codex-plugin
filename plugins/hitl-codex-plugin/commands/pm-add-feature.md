# Add a New Feature Requirement

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS (description of the feature)

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask: "What feature do you want to add? Describe what the user should be able to do."

**Graphify pre-flight:** Before the first step, run:
```bash
[ -f graphify-out/graph.json ] && echo "Graphify: available" || echo "Graphify: unavailable"
```
State the result once — "✅ Graphify available, using graph queries" or "⚠️ Graphify unavailable — using direct doc reads throughout." Apply that result for every step; do not rediscover availability mid-task.

## Challenge Level — Ask First

Before step 1, ask:

> "What level of challenge would you like?
> - **Rigorous** — I'll push back until I have specific answers. Nothing gets drafted without justification.
> - **Moderate** — I'll ask all questions and flag gaps, but won't block on every one.
> - **Light** — I'll ask the essentials only and move fast.
>
> Default is **Moderate** if you don't specify."

## Progress Banners

At the start of each milestone — before questions or content — output a banner. Format: `---` line, `**Add Feature — Step N / 5: Name**`, trail, `---`.

| Step | Name | Banner trail |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Questions | `▶ Questions · ○ Research · ○ Draft · ○ Review · ○ Publish` |
| 2 | Research | `✅ Questions · ▶ Research · ○ Draft · ○ Review · ○ Publish` |
| 3 | Draft | `✅ Questions · ✅ Research · ▶ Draft · ○ Review · ○ Publish` |
| 4 | Review | `✅ Questions · ✅ Research · ✅ Draft · ▶ Review · ○ Publish` |
| 5 | Publish | `✅ Questions · ✅ Research · ✅ Draft · ✅ Review · ▶ Publish` |

## Steps

*→ Output Step 1 progress banner.*

1. **Challenge before drafting** — before touching the PRD, ask the following. Apply the chosen challenge level.

   **TODO deferral is always available.** Any time the PM says "not sure", "add to TODO", "come back to this", or similar — record the item and proceed. Do not block on it.

   - **[All levels]** "What is the delivery surface?" Web UI, mobile, API/backend only, agentic workflow, internal/ops tool, or a combination? Always required — blocks at every level.

     *Follow-up probe (if vague or combo):* "Is there a primary surface, or are they equal-priority?"

   - **[All levels]** "What evidence confirms this is a real problem?" What are users doing or saying that points to this gap?

     *Follow-up probe (after any answer):* "Do you have a rough sense of how widespread this is — even a ballpark? If not, we can add it to open items."
     - *Rigorous*: one follow-up probe; if still no data, offer TODO deferral and note the gap
     - *Moderate*: offer TODO deferral if no data; note the gap and proceed
     - *Light*: ask once; if no answer, note and proceed

   - **[All levels]** "What does success look like?" What would tell you this feature worked?

     *Follow-up probe (after any answer):* "Do you have a rough current baseline or a hypothesis for how you'd validate this? If not, we can park it."
     - *Rigorous*: one follow-up probe; accept rough metric, hypothesis + validation plan, or TODO deferral
     - *Moderate*: accept any answer or TODO deferral; note the gap
     - *Light*: ask once; note if vague

   - **[Rigorous + Moderate]** "What's explicitly out of scope?" Unstated non-goals become scope creep.
     - *Rigorous*: one follow-up if skipped; offer TODO if still no answer
     - *Moderate*: ask; if skipped, note in summary

   At the end of this step, if any items were deferred, present the open items list:

   > **Open items to revisit before this feature ships:**
   > - [ ] [Question label]: [what's missing]

   At **Light**, summarize any unanswered questions as "Gaps to revisit" in the draft rather than blocking on them.

**Create a draft GitHub issue immediately after Step 1 is confirmed.** The feature needs to be tracked before design work starts:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "feat: <feature description>" \
  --body "## Status: Requirements in progress\n\n**Problem:** <problem from evidence question>\n**Success looks like:** <from success metric question>\n\n*PRD reference will be added at Step 5. Acceptance criteria live in the PRD, not this issue.*" \
  --label "requirements"
```

Note the issue number — it will be updated with the PRD reference at Step 5.

*→ Output Step 2 progress banner.*

2. **Get the existing requirements structure** — prefer a graph query if available:
   ```
   /graphify query "all requirement IDs and use case numbers from PRD"
   /graphify query "PRD format and requirement areas FR-<AREA>"
   ```
   Fall back to reading `docs/01-product/prd.md` directly if the graph is unavailable or stale. You need the full document to pick the correct next ID and follow the exact format.

*→ Output Step 3 progress banner.*

3. **Draft the requirement** following the existing format:
   - Requirement ID: next available `FR-<AREA>-N` (look at the existing IDs to pick the right area and number)
   - Description: what the user can do
   - Priority: Must Have / Should Have / Could Have
   - Acceptance criteria: specific, testable conditions
   - Implementation file: leave blank (the team fills this in)

4. **If the feature implies a new use case**, also draft a UC entry:
   - Actor
   - Preconditions
   - Flow (numbered steps)
   - Expected outcome
   - Error scenarios

5. **Check for conflicts** — does this feature contradict or duplicate any existing requirement? Flag it.

*→ Output Step 4 progress banner.*

6. **Present the draft** to the user for review. Do NOT update the PRD until they approve.

*→ Output Step 5 progress banner.*

7. **On approval**, update `docs/01-product/prd.md` with the new requirement (and use case if applicable).

8. **Update the GitHub issue** created in Step 1 — update the title only, then add the PRD reference as a comment. Do NOT overwrite the body: the problem statement captured at Step 1 is the permanent audit trail.
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <issue-number-from-step-1> --title "feat: <short description>"
   gh issue comment <issue-number-from-step-1> \
     --body "## ✅ Requirements Complete\n\nPRD: FR-<ID> — \`docs/01-product/prd.md\`\n\nAcceptance criteria are in the PRD at FR-<ID>."
   ```

## Important Rules

- Follow the EXACT format used in the existing PRD — don't invent a new structure
